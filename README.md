### 📌 About Me

I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion for tech, logic, and building stuff that actually works.  
Some people are into games — I'm into code.

Currently in my final IGCSE year, diving deep into full-stack development and gearing up for startup life.  
I got into coding because I was obsessed with how computers work.  
Now, I’m the one behind the curtain — the wizard making the magic happen.
